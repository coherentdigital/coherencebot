1. Upgrade Tika dependency (tika-core) in ivy/ivy.xml

2. Upgrade Tika dependency in src/plugin/parse-headings/ivy.xml

3. Upgrade Tika's own dependencies in src/plugin/parse-headings/plugin.xml

   To get the list of dependencies and their versions execute:
    $ cd src/plugin/parse-headings/
    $ ant -f ./build-ivy.xml
    $ ls lib | sed 's/^/      <library name="/g' | sed 's/$/"\/>/g'

   In the plugin.xml replace all lines between
      <!-- dependencies of Tika (tika-parsers) -->
   and
      <!-- end of dependencies of Tika (tika-parsers) -->
   with the output of the command above.

4. (Optionally) remove overlapping dependencies between parse-headings and Nutch core dependencies:
   - check for libs present both in
       build/lib
     and
       build/plugins/parse-headings/
     (eventually with different versions)
   - duplicated libs can be added to the exclusions of transitive dependencies in
       build/plugins/parse-headings/ivy.xml
   - but it should be made sure that the library versions in ivy/ivy.xml correspond to
     those required by Tika

5. Remove the locally "installed" dependencies in src/plugin/parse-headings/lib/:

    $ rm -rf lib/

6. Build Nutch and run all unit tests:

    $ cd ../../../
    $ ant clean runtime test
